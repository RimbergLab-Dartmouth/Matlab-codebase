*** stage all files (new, deleted, modified)
git add -A


*** reset all modifications and deletion and clean all untracked files
when you want to get rid of today's work (anything that hasn't been commited yet)
git reset --hard
git clean -f -d


*** Check if a file is tracked, returns error if not tracked
git ls-files --error-unmatch <file name>


*** Ultimate reset:
delete the directory and git clone + url again, this should work in theory but is untested
