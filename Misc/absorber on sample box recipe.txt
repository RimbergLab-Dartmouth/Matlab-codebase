Mix the following together in the following order:
       Stycast 1266 part A: 4.00 g
       Mix in Stycast 1266 part B: 1.12 g
       Mix in crystalline silica grains (MIN-U-SIL 5 - Mill creek plant):
3.00 g
       Mix in carbon: 0.12 g 
   Place in vacuum to get the air bubbles out, pump ~15 mins.
   Take a paintbrush and coat the copper can thinly
   Throw in the 1mm SiC? grains. Make sure there is ample
   Heat up the stuff to 100 C and wait 1-2 hrs till the bottom layer of the
grains are firmly fixed.
   Throw out the excess grains and thinly coat the grains with the black
coating. Make sure the grains are fully coated, but don't use too much - if
there is too much you'll make the surface too smooth again.
   Heat up the stuff so it solidifies in a few hrs. 

Note airborne silica grains cause lung problems, so wear a mask. They wet to
water very easily though so cleaning up spilled silica with water is easy
(and not dangerous).
   Mix gently to put as little air into the mixture as possible (so it
doesn't take as long to pump out).
   Watch the mixture while pumping. It will "muffin" up and you should
break vacuum briefly when it's close to spilling over to punch it down again
(like a time-lapsed bread rising).
   It is difficult to get all sides of the grains black if you're brushing
over them. Even though it may seem tedious, you'll be better off if you
"dot" the grain-covered surface. Be a Pointillist.
   For any decent sized can you're going to need many makings of this
recipe. You can double (or triple, etc.) it if you have a big enough mixing
cup (i.e. one with enough surface area that it pumps out in a reasonable
time). For this amount we used cup that had about the volume of a coffee
mug, but shorter and wider. To quote Ted, "like a small version of one of
those soup bowls you get in Chinese restaurants." In any event, you can tell
when you're done pumping as it stops "muffin"-ing.
